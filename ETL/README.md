Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) operations are of extreme importance in the role of a Data engineer. 
A data engineer extracts data from multiple sources and different file formats, transforms the extracted data to predefined settings and then loads the data to a database for further processing. 

Objectives:

1. Read CSV, JSON, and XML file types.
2. Extract the required data from the different file types.
3. Transform data to the required format.
4. Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format, which can be loaded into an RDBMS.

Download the zip file containing the required data in multiple formats.
