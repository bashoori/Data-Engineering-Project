Using databases is an important and useful method of sharing information. 
To preserve repeated storage of the same files containing the required data, it is a good practice to save the data on a database on a server and access the required subset of information using database management systems.

In this script, I loaded data from a CSV file as a table in a database, and then run queries on the data using Python.

Objectives:

1. Create a database using Python

2. Load the data from a CSV file as a table to the database

3. Run basic "queries" on the database to access the information

4. here's the CSV, run this command to download the file:

wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-PY0221EN-Coursera/labs/v2/INSTRUCTOR.csv
