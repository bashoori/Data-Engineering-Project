Web scraping is used for extraction of relevant data from web pages. 
If you require some data from a web page in a public domain, web scraping makes the process of data extraction quite convenient. 
The use of web scraping, however, requires some basic knowledge of the structure of HTML pages. 
In this project, I did the process of analyzing the HTML code of a web page and extracted the required information from it using web scraping in Python.

Scenario:
Consider that you have been hired by a Multiplex management organization to extract the information of the top 50 movies with the best average rating from the web link shared below.

https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185655/https://en.everybodywiki.com/100_Most_Highly-Ranked_Films

The information required is Average Rank, Film, and Year.
I required to write a Python script webscraping_movies.py that extracts the information and saves it to a CSV file top_50_films.csv.
